## Experiences

I wrote my first application when i was 11 years old. It was a economy game, I wrote it in Visual Basic. After that, i began to do a lot more work around Desktop Development. I learned C# and VB .NET better in that procedure. After learning those, i wanted to create social media bots and make my raspberry pi do stuff. So i learned Javascript (Node.js) and Python. While i was learning javascript, i was also creating portfolio designs and web app designs. After that, i got interested on Operating systems, Linux and embedded systems. I'm currently learning C++ and Assembly.
